Login with root to ssh console on your AREDN Router:
Paste following command in your shell

curl -s -L http://hb-aredn-srvt01.local.mesh/phonebook/installpb.sh | sh
Press Enter

The command / Script install all nessesary's Folders, cronjob, and TFTP Service.
After installation the router reboot automaticly


Now you can configure the Remotephonebook on your Yealink Webinterface.
Create a new Remotephonebook and use following URL: tftp://localnode.local.mesh/phonebook.xml

Now you have a Phonebook, that wil replicate every 30min's from the source over the meshnetwork.
In these Phonebook are directdial Entrys implemented they can be used make calls without the PBX -directly phone 2 phone.

But i can bee nessesary to make a portforward on your AREDN Router for the Yealink Phone (for P2P calls)
I will check that to implement these in the installscript in future.
